# Trabalho final de Fundamentos de Epidemiologia

The task is to choose a specific disease, search the literature for epidemiological studies on it, and present a report on the selected studies. The report should include a general introduction to the disease, a methodology section that summarizes the selected studies, a results section that describes each study's methodology and compares their results, and a discussion section that analyzes the compatibility of the results. Details below.


## General Introduction

- Choose a disease and search for literature on it.
- Describe the disease in detail in the report. This should include what the disease is, who it affects, the symptoms, known treatments, etc.
- Report on the objectives of your own work.


## Methodology

- Find at least one paper for four of the five types of epidemiological studies covered in class.
- Ensure that the studies are somewhat comparable. For example, do not try to compare a cohort study performed in Peru with a case-control study performed in Germany. Note that a randomized control trial can be an exception to this rule.
- Briefly present each paper as a micro or even nano abstract.


## Results

- Briefly describe each of the selected studies, focusing on their methodology.
- Compare the results of the different studies.
- Attempt to replicate the performed analyses. If you cannot perform the same type of analyses, replace them with an adequate alternative.
- Compare the original results with your own and explain any methodological differences.
- Include any code used as an appendix or, even better, bundle your R scripts with the report.


## Discussion

- Discuss how compatible the results from multiple studies are.
- Were they possible to replicate?
- Analyze how these studies are connected.
- Are your results compatible with the original studies'?
- Conclude with your opinion on the matter.
